*by Flo Titze (florian.titze@ironhack.com), last updated 03rd of March, 2021.  Updated for use at Amsterdam campus by Erin Berardi (erin.berardi@ironhack.com) August 2021*

Dear future TA of the Data Analytics Bootcamp, this is a cheat sheet for you in order not to get lost in your first days of TA'ing :-)


# 1. General workflow of the Week

General weekly structure, except project weeks (times and blocks may change, especially lunchtime)

|time|Mo|Tu|We|Th|Fr|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **9-10 am** |morning activity|morning activity|morning activity|morning activity|retrospective (**TA** assisted)|
| **10am - around 12:00am** |Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|
| **12:00 - 1:00 pm** |Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|
| **1:00 - 2:00 pm** | Lunch |Lunch|Lunch|Lunch|Lunch|
| **2:00 pm - around 4:30 pm** |Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|Lecture & activities|
| **4:30 - 6:00 pm** |Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|Labs (**TAs**)|

* **Morning activity**: Mostly LT's realm. Conduct Kahoot quizzes, morning activity (see sheet in drive folder) etc. Get students warmed up for the day. Take into account 10 minutes break before lecture starts at 10 am.
* **Labs**: Solely TA's realm. Students are supposed to tackle the labs they find in their student portal (or do group work in this time). At best, prepare for these labs yourself to be able to explain what it is about, and how to solve them. Solutions are to be found on (->) GitHub or TA created.

Non-TA-responsibilities:
* Lecture & Activities (although you might receive questions regarding these)

# 2. TA's responsibilities

## 1-on-1s

* happen **at least 2 times over the whole bootcamp**.
* teaching staff supported by *Ironhack* staff (program manager, Outcomes people sometimes) interview everyone in the Data class for 10-20 minutes.
* **Purpose**: Get a feeling about how students feel at the moment, blockers, pain points, expectations they had that are (not) met, suggestions which they have to improve the course. A rough question framework can (but doesn't have to) be:

  * *How have the last week(s) been?*
  * *What is your motivation to start IH what do you except to get out of your bootcamp experience?*
  * *Have you used the career services (I usually advice them to reach out to Hang if they have any questions or concerns about, they have a happy hour every Wednesday where students can contact them)*
  * *What was your biggest challenges/problems/triumphs*  
  * *What would you like to have improved/changed in the bootcamps?*

* Take notes during the interviews and write up your notes into the (->) TA Control Panel on google drive


## TODO: Add more TA responsibilities here

* Keep morale in class high!
* Follow-up with struggling students.
* Alert LT to any red flags in class.
* Introduce and Run labs.

# 3. TA's best practices (when multiple TAs)

* Distribute work according to skills / preferences
* meet / talk often
* coordinate among each other about time-off's
* you don't have to know everything!!!

# 4. Tools

here's an overview of all the tools of the teaching team & of the students and how they relate.

<!---!The most important one is **Notion**.

<!---![alt text](tool_map_lts.png) -->

<!---!
## 4.0 notion

Primary tool of communication & source of material (apart from slack)

* **Our calendar**, links to labs, material
* **Additional Ressources**
* **Katas**
* **Our Recordings**, lecture Recordings
* etc. ...
-->


## 4.0 TA google Email

This is the key to a lot of services and online tools (google drive, Asana, kahoot, ...). Just add it to your browser and use for login when required.

|||
|---|---|
| email | `ta-dataft-rmt@ironhack.com`|
| password | `RemoteRocks22.` |

Email received here should be checked regularly. Sometimes students from upcoming courses send questions to this Email address. It is not necessary to answer them right away, but within 24hrs would be nice.

[Class Google Drive][https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RMd2HC-GG7aM6lzXoL_IzUH7YHZK05tD?usp=sharing]



## 4.1 Campustools

General administration of students an get several information about them. On the left side, click on `Cohorts` and filter by Status `Ongoing` and then click the Data Analytics Full Time RMT class having started at 9 August to pull up info about the current Data class taught by Jan.
* Login with the (->) TA google account.
* The whole tool is coupled with the Student Portal of the students in a sense that it tracks the uploaded assignments.
* Also (->) **1-on-1 information** are saved here by the TA's and teaching staff.
* File the students' attendance here, track the students learning progress
* Check here if they have completed the **weekly survey** (usually checked by program manager)
* Grade their work here

## 4.2 github

The class repository is this: https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BEES-DAFT-MAY21

* You need to be added as contributor to make changes. Ask the LT.

* As TA, please keep an eye on the repo so that is is clean and has a clear structure.

* lab solutions must be pushed here usually at the end of the day

## 4.3 CMS (Studio)

*The following doesn't apply for the 2021-05 BER cohort anymore, since most of the material will be provided to students on Notion! Studio/Campus tools will only be used for students to submit deliverables*

Everything which the students get to see in their Student Portal can be changed here.
* Our current re-run of the course is this: https://studio.ironhack.school/course/course-v1:IRONHACK+DAFT+202105_BER

* Sign in with:
  * Email: `ta-dataft-rmt@ironhack.com`
  * PW: `ironhack`        (yeah, sorry.)

* Most often used to insert events (guest talks) & shift around lecture / lab / activity blocks around. Get greenlight from LT  before you make changes here.
* Click on the Unit (week) and then `+ New Unit` to add a new event to a specific day.
* Newly added events will only be shown in students' Student Portal when they're published.
* When you click on one event and edit everything. Include all information relevant for the students (Event timeframe, zoom-link, project descriptions, etc.). You can also generate a preview of how it would look like in the Student Portal (upper right corner)
* Make use of the predefined tags for certain event categories to make the events better distinguishable by color, such as `[CLASS_ACTIVITY]`, `[TALK]`, `[RITUALS]`, `[PROJECT]`...
* Please don't alter anything on the actual curriculum content (`[CLASS_ACTIVITY]`, `[LAB]`, Lectures). Changes here are only done by the LT or the education team.

## 4.4 Google drive

Where important course material (for our own course) is stored. All TA's can edit documents here simultaneously
* Login: With TA google account
* All Data `My Drive > Data`
* ~~Data for current class: (`My Drive > Data > 2020/10/19`)~~
* Within that, the central document: [`Control Panel | DAFT BER 2021-05`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJIIaqxnch2td0mjiG68prXsGN_GL6nodtwtRr1Kuy0/edit#gid=515994834) sheet. A lot of documentation about Project grading, 1-on-1's, student progress etc. are collected in there.
* Sheet [`Frequently Encountered Installation Problems & Solutions - DATA ANALYTICS`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/145BD_C1dBB1dIwNM6YkjzDRyXY6mtXYe2ObPhnPg-QU/edit#gid=0): Collection of all common errors, installation problems, etc. when using any Data Analytics Software (SQL, Python, Tableau, etc... ) that occured in the past and their solutions. Please expand, whenever you encountered such a blocker with students and found a solution.

## 4.5 Slack

Most of online communication (apart from Zoom) happens here

* our current workspace: [DA-FT-RMT-08-21](daft09augen.slack.com)

Usage: Pretty much self explanatory. Should be known to Alumni-TAs.

<!-- ## 4.8. Bitbucket

~~Find all curriculum material in here (Lectures, activities, Labs, Lab solutions, ...). Works like git.

* Link: https://bitbucket.org/ironhack/data
* Lesson plan can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/ironhack/data/src/master/01-lesson_plans/
* **Lab-solutions**: Click on the specific lesson (meaning 'unit' - there are 9 of them, for 9 weeks bootcamp). Then click on the the `.md` file that says `*_list_of_labs_and_solutions.md`. In there you find all the Labs and their solutions linked.

* Access: Given to your Ironhack Account by the Learning Designers (SofÃ­a Delponte e.g.)~~


 ## 4.9. Notion

A whole new world presented to you by the education team with teaching material, places to give feedback, notes for meetings etc.
* Access given by the education team
* Browse through the whole data seciton [here]().
  * Get an overview of the whole data analytics curriculum [here](https://www.notion.so/DATA2020-Overview-v-03-20c8715950af4b4587f4ccb526825c97)
  * in there, we have a [data bookshelf with literature](https://www.notion.so/Data-Bookshelf-2958f5f7c14f4b3db7546c2902faf89c). Feel free to add more items.
-->

## 4.6 Zoom

* Students & Teaching staff convene in the main room of the Data (Analytics) classroom for lecture (starting 9am on weekdays)

* **Classroom link**: `https://ironhack.zoom.us/j/96403567276`, **ID**: `877626245`, **pw**: `986565` (share with students and/or pin at the top of the general channel in the Slack workspace)

* **Admin-access** to the Data Analytics zoom account (**don't share with anyone!**): Login `jan.molendijk@ironhack.com`, pw: `IronHack1!`

* **Claiming Host** in the zoom classroom (not possible when someone is already host): Use Host Key: 236158 (never share this outside the teaching team). Important e.g. for creating breakout rooms (BRs) for students when they're doing project work or need to swarm out during activities. Only Host can create BRs. Rule of thumb / courtesy / best practice: Whoever is Host in an active zoom call never goes AFK unless she/he makes someone else host.

* Co-Hosts can be designated by the host. They can assign people to BRs.

* BRs are at best set up in a way that students can join them on their own.

| rights | Host | Co-Host | Normal user | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| creating breakout rooms | Yes| No | No | when claimed host rights |
| manage created breakout rooms | Yes | Yes | No | when claimed host rights |
| start, stop, pause recording | Yes| Yes | No | when claimed host rights |
| claim host rights | not applicable | only when no Host is present | Only, when no host is present | any time |

* **Keeping an eye on the recording**: Host & Co-Host can start/stop recording of the lecture (necessary!). If you're Host/Co-Host and see it's not recording, start it, and stop it after lecture.

* After every lecture day, Zoom needs a couple of hours "to process" the video until it's available to download within the Admin's (usually the LT) zoom account. The links of that day's zoom videos then need to be put on the student portal as a separate block at the end of the day, so that the students can download/view them. They're not supposed to be shared outside of Ironhack though (due to privacy reasons).

-- ## 4.7 Miro board

-- * URL: https://miro.com/app/dashboard/
-- * Needs to be cleaned before Friday retrospective
-- * Assist the LT in clustering the sticky notes after the Retro

## 4.8 Kahoot.com

* here chose **not** to login via google, enter credentials manually:
* login: `ta-dataft-rmt@ironhack.com`,  pw: `HelloName2020-06`
* Browse past kahoots. Some may be suitable for your current cohort as well. Or create new kahoots by getting inspired by old ones.
